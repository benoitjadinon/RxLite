         * value, we will notify ReactiveObject that the property has changed.
         * 
         * To do this, we have a class called ObservableAsPropertyHelper - this
         * class subscribes to an Observable and stores a copy of the latest value.
         * It also runs an action whenever the property changes, usually calling
         * ReactiveObject's RaisePropertyChanged.
